# Netflix - Project Analysis 


### TV Shows and Movies listed on Netflix

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

### Motivation 

With the given dataset I want to discover the following:

1) What is more viewed, tv shows or movies?
2) What countries have the highest viewing rates?
3) What genre is the most popular?
4) Do other countries have a preferred genre?
5) Trend of movie / tv show releases in the past decade
